# Lepton Examples

This repo contains a collection of sample applications you can build and run with Lepton.
Feel free to modify and use these examples as a starting point for your own applications.

The example repo is organized into the following directories:
- getting-started: A collection of simple examples that demonstrate the basics of building and running simple photons, which are light-weight, single-file applications.
- applications: A collection of more complex examples that demonstrate how to build and run real-world applications, such as LLMs, image search, object segmentation, and more.
- notebooks: A collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use Lepton's Python SDK.
